GAME PLAY: 
TL;DR Gather gems for points. If you touch a beatle you lose points. The more points you have the faster the beatles go. If a gem disappears before you gather it you lose points. 

The goal is get your score as high as possible. Unlike many traditional games this one offers no ending, you simply play until you are satisfied that you have stolen enough gems from the stinkin' beatles. To gain points gather gems before they disappear. Here are the values of the different gems.

Blue: 1 point
Green: 2 points
Orange: 3 points

Great. This sounds easy right? You can just charge around aimlessly, regardless of beatles and snatch every gem as it appears... FALSE! You lose 25 points every time you touch a beatle and are returned to the starting point. Get it? "STAR"-ting point. Ya know... because there is a start on it. Bwhahaha!

Okay so you have to dodge the beatles. You can just wait around for the opportune time to grab an easy gem... FALSE! Gems don't stick around forever and you lose points if you don't gather them before they disappear. Here are the gems' point loss values and their durations.

Blue:  lose 9 point, last 5 seconds
Green: lose 6 points, last 4 seconds
Orange: lose 3 points, last 3 seconds

Alright - dodge beatle and be quick to grab gems. The beatles are nice and slow. You've got this right? Well just one more thing... the more points you have the faster the beatles can go. 

Good luck. Steal as many gems as you can from those darn beatles!
